# MQ4_Detecteur_Gaz
Gas detector to be safe @ home

Will flash arduino nano with this program.
Now packaging to fit the device in the kitchen and warn in case of gas leak or if someone just forgets to switch the cooker off.
Used sensor MQ-4 designed for this kind of gas. Before buying one of the MQ serie, read the associated datasheet and pay attention to which type it will be useful for.
